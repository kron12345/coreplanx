# Documentation Rules (LLM-Friendly)

This project uses existing documentation in `/docs` as the source of truth for behavior and workflows.

Requirements for LLM-friendly documentation updates:
- Use clear, structured sections and subpages under `/docs`.
- Include screenshots where helpful to explain UI flows.
- Prefer concise, task-focused pages and cross-link related topics.

When behavior changes, update the relevant documentation pages (or create new subpages) in `/docs`.
